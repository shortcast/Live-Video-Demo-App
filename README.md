# Mirror Live Video integration demo

This is a sample app built on react showing how you would go about integrating with our API. You should use it as a starting point for your application, but please note that you shouldn't expose your API keys publicly as in this sample; make sure to use a backend service that'll call our API instead.

## To install this app.
You will have to set up an API key, and get at least one project and user account. Once you have those, place the corresponding values in your .env file (check .env.sample).

After that, just run the app like so:
```
npm install
npm start
```

Or, ir you prefer using docker, you can run `docker-compose up`.

You'll be able to access the web app on `localhost:8085`.
